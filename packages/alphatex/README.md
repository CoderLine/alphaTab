# alphaTex Language Definitions

This folder contains the overall language definitions for alphaTex. These definitions define what metadata tags exist,
what parameters they support, the that exist etc. 

These definitions are used to generate 

1. parser related code embedded in the main alphaTab library.
2. definitions needed by the language server to provide coding assistence. 
3. The documentation website for alphaTex describing all available elements.

We do not maintain a formal documentation of how to write definitions and how the tooling works. It's recommended
that you look at the existing definitions and try to derive from the code how things are working. Feel free to ask on GitHub if you want more details.
