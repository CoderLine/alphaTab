# Features
alphaTab mostly focuses on web based platforms allowing music notation to be embedded into websites and browser based apps but is designed to be used also from .net based platforms like Windows, UWP and Xamarin.

alphaTab can load music notation from various sources like Guitar Pro 3-7, AlphaTex and MusicXML (experimental) and render them into beautiful music sheets right within your browser (or application). Using a built in midi synthesizer named alphaSynth the music sheets can also be played in your browser.

* load GuitarPro 3-5, GuitarPro 6, AlphaTex or MusicXML (experimental)
* render as SVG, HTML5 canvas, GDI+,...
* display single or multiple instruments as standard music notation and guitar tablatures consisting of song information, repeats, alternate endings, guitar tunints, clefs, key signatures, time signatures, notes, rests, accidentals, drum tabs, piano grand staff, tied notes, grace notes, dead notes, ghost notes, markers, tempos, lyrics, chords, vibratos, dynamics, tap/slap/pop, fade-in, let-ring, palm-mute, string bends, whammy bar, tremolo picking, strokes, slides, trills, pick strokes, tuplets, fingering, triplet feels,...
* adapt to your responsive design by dynamic resizing
* play the music sheet via HTML5 Web Audio API (only if browser supports it)
