# Features
alphaTab mostly focuses on web based platforms allowing music notation to be embedded into websites and browser based apps but is designed to be used also from .net based platforms like Windows, UWP and Xamarin. 

Before reading further you might simply jump to our demos: 

> [Feature Demo](https://docs.alphatab.net/master/features/) - *Take a look at all visual elements that alphaTab can render*
>
> [Player Demo](https://docs.alphatab.net/master/assets/files/player.html) - *By integrating alphaSynth the you get a web based music sheet player* 
>
> [alphaTex Introduction](https://docs.alphatab.net/master/alphatex/) - *Learn about alphaTex, the built-in markup language for writing music notation*

alphaTab can load music notation from various sources like Guitar Pro 3-5, Guitar Pro 6, AlphaTex and MusicXML (experimental) and render them into beautiful music sheets right within your browser (or application). Using [alphaSynth](http://github.com/CoderLine/alphaSynth) the music sheets can also be played in your browser without the need of any plugins (HTML5 Web Audio if available, fallback to flash) .

* load GuitarPro 3-5, GuitarPro 6, AlphaTex or MusicXML (experimental)
* render as SVG, HTML5 canvas, GDI+,... 
* display single or multiple instruments as standard music notation and guitar tablatures consisting of song information, repeats, alternate endings, guitar tunints, clefs, key signatures, time signatures, notes, rests, accidentals, drum tabs, piano grand staff, tied notes, grace notes, dead notes, ghost notes, markers, tempos, lyrics, chords, vibratos, dynamics, tap/slap/pop, fade-in, let-ring, palm-mute, string bends, whammy bar, tremolo picking, strokes, slides, trills, pick strokes, tuplets, fingering, triplet feels,... 
* adapt to your responsive design by dynamic resizing 
* play the music sheet via HTML5 Web Audio API and Flash
