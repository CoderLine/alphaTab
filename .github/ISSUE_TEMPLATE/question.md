Additionally for questions

- Be sure that you are not reporting bugs or missing features as questions! If you are missing a feature or 
  experiencing a misbehavior, it is very likely not a question but rather a bug report or feature request you 
  want to open. 
- Check the examples and documentation at https://docs.alphatab.net/ if it might already answer your question.
- Check if somebody already asked the question here on GitHub.
