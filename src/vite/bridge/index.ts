// The files in this folder contain a wide range of internal functions we adapted or copy/pasted from
// vite. Many of these functions are not exposed but needed to rebuild/adapt the worker
// plugin. We hope to get the official worker and custom syntax support into
// vite directly, but progress there is rather slow.

// So we adapted the original plugins and customized them to our needs of alphaTab.
// We try to reference as good as possible the origin of every function.
