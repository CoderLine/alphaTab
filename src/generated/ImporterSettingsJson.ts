     * Enables detecting lyrics from beat texts

     * @category Importer
     * @defaultValue `false`
     * @remarks
     *
     * On various old Guitar Pro 3-5 files tab authors often used the "beat text" feature to add lyrics to the individual tracks.
     * This was easier and quicker than using the lyrics feature.
     *
     * These texts were optimized to align correctly when viewed in Guitar Pro with the default layout but can lead to
     * disturbed display in alphaTab. When `beatTextAsLyrics` is set to true, alphaTab will try to rather parse beat text
     * values as lyrics using typical text patterns like dashes, underscores and spaces.
     *
     * The lyrics are only detected if not already proper lyrics are applied to the track.
     *
     * Enable this option for input files which suffer from this practice.
     *
     * > [!NOTE]
     * > alphaTab tries to relate the texts and chunks to the beats but this is not perfect.
     * > Errors are likely to happen with such kind of files.
