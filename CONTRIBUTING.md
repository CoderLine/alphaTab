# Guidelines for Contributing to alphaTab. 

I am happy that you are interested in alphaTab and want to contribute by entering bugs, feature requests, asking questions or even contribute code. Please play with the rules. It's not only about what you say, but also how you say it. Playing nice increases the chance of getting features/bugfixes faster :wink: Remember that everything you get here is for free and in the end it's about giving and taking. 

## Before entering an issue

**Please follow the provided templates when entering issues. It is crucial to provide the asked information to reduce the effort on our side to handle all the incoming requests. We see a strong tendency of people not providing the asked information and we need to make multiple rounds to find out first what's happening on their side. It should be possible for every developer to take 2 additional minutes of time to enter issues in a proper structured way and by this reduce a multiple of this time on our side.**

**We will close issues not following the template without further discussion.**

Beside that: 

* Check if your topic has already been covered. Use the search function and respond to an existing issue instead of opening a new one if you find a match. 
* Double check you are using the right template. We get a lot of feature requests or bug reports as via the question template. If something is not yet available or not working, it is very likely not a question but rather a missing feature or misbehavior.
